# SquareRootSolver

A **short and concise Python program** that estimates the square root of a number using three numerical methods:

- **Bisection Method**
- **Simple Iteration**
- **Newton's Method**

This program demonstrates iterative algorithms and shows the number of iterations required for each method. Despite its brevity, it is fully functional and easy to understand, making it ideal for educational purposes or quick experimentation.

## Features

- Finds square roots of numbers numerically.
- Compares multiple root-finding methods.
- Minimal and readable code.
- Highly customizable (change the target number, precision, or maximum iterations).


 ### Bisection method, simple iteration, and Newton's method applied to x^2 - 17
